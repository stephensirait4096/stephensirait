Hi, I’m @stephensirait4096!

I’m an electrical power engineering⚡ undergraduate, but sometimes I code💻 too.
I had learnt about basic🌱 programming (I/O↕, conditionals❔, loops🔄, functions🛠) in Python.
Currently, I'm learning basic C++, and I'd like😄 to learn other languages too👍 (well, if I had plenty of my time⌚, lol).
